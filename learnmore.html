<p>It’s often necessary to reserve our emotions; co-operating in a work environment, respecting cultural differences, functioning as a society, and more.  When life feels challenging, the volume of positive self-promotion delivered through social media can feel discouraging; tempting users to repress negative emotions and jump on the ‘I have the best life ever!’ bandwagon.  Repressing complex emotions can makes it easier to connect with a greater volume of people, however these ‘feel-good’ connections are generally less meaningful and can leave us feeling empty and strange. </p>

<p>In its early stages, the internet was something to fear.  Users were extremely cautious of the information shared online.  Today, online banking, shopping, dating, and social-networking are just a few of the popular activities supported online.  Social network activity continues to increase with the rise of smartphones.  As an avid user of social networking, both online and in the flesh, I recognize the pressure many users put on themselves to maintain a ‘positive image.’  I know certain things are better left unsaid.  However, I feel people would experience more happiness if they made a conscious effort to share from their hearts, opening the door for more meaningful connections.  </p>

<p>Be-YOU-tiful encourages users to develop a better relationship with themselves through the following concepts: gratitude, challenge, desire, help, share, and appreciate.  These concepts are intended to make users more conscious of the content they post.  The mind is an extremely powerful tool.  By feeling our emotions and acknowledging our thoughts, we can filter through the everyday noise and make better decisions as to where we want to be, what we want to experience, and who complements us best.</p>

<p>Users will publish content in “Trove” and then decide whether or not their content is made public.  The public forum is intended to show that all humans experience ups and downs.  Meaningful connections can be made online, but the self-reflection component is intended for users to develop a better understanding of themselves so they are more aware and open to meaningful connections in all areas of life.</p>
